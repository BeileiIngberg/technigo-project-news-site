        <p>
          An astounding progress has been made in the botanical sphere. A new kind of leaf has been found in
          the Brazilian Amazon.

      <p>Surface of leaf raised in a series of domes between the veins on the upper surface, and therefore also with
        marked depressions. e.g. Rytigynia pauciflora,[71] Vitis vinifera</p>

      <p>Veins sunken below the surface, resulting in a rounded channel. Sometimes confused with "guttered" because the
        channels may function as gutters for rain to run off and allow drying, as in many Melastomataceae.</p>

      <p>Leaves are initiated in the apical bud (growing tip of a stem) along with the tissues of the stem itself.
        Certain organs that are superficially very different from the usual green leaf are formed in the same manner and
        are actually modified leaves. </p>

      <p>The main function of a leaf is to produce food for the plant by photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, the substance that
        gives plants their characteristic green colour, absorbs light energy. The internal structure of the leaf is
        protected by the leaf epidermis, which is continuous with the stem epidermis.

      <p>Vein forming raised line or ridge which lies below the plane of the surface which bears it, as if pressed into
        it, and are often exposed on the lower surface. Tissue near the veins often appears to pucker, giving them a
        sunken or embossed appearance. </p>

      <p>Pinnate (feather-veined) leaves, with a main central vein or rib (midrib), from which the remainder of the vein
        system arises. Palmate, in which three or more main ribs rise together at the base of the leaf, and diverge
        upward. </p>

      <p>The oxygen liberated from green leaves replaces the oxygen removed from the atmosphere by plant and animal
        respiration and by combustion. The hydrogen obtained from water is combined with carbon dioxide in the enzymatic
        processes of photosynthesis to form the sugars that are the basis of both plant and animal life.</p>

      <p>Open: Higher order veins have free endings among the cells and are more characteristic of non-monocotyledon
        angiosperms. They are more likely to be associated with leaf shapes that are toothed, lobed or compound. </p>
